Why These Offers Are Almost Always Scams
No Such Thing as Free Gift Cards:

Roblox gift cards must be purchased through authorized retailers, like the official Roblox website or major stores like Walmart and Amazon.
Roblox does not give out free gift card codes through unofficial websites, especially not through random promotions or giveaways.
Phishing and Account Theft:

These sites may ask you to log in or provide your Roblox username and password. This is an attempt to steal your account. Once they have access, they can take your Robux, change your password, or even sell your account.
Malware Risk:

Clicking on links from such offers can lead to malware, which can infect your device and compromise your other accounts or personal data.
Fake Proofs and Deceptive Tactics:

Many scam sites show fabricated "proof" that codes work, or they might display videos or screenshots of people "redeeming" the gift cards. These are all staged to make the scam seem legitimate.
Signs of a Scam to Look Out For
Too Good to Be True:

Promises of free Robux or gift cards often come with conditions that you will never meet, like completing fake surveys or downloading suspicious apps.
Request for Personal Information:

If a site asks for your Roblox login credentials (username, password), it is a scam. Roblox will never ask for this outside of the official login page.
Unfamiliar or Suspicious URLs:

Always ensure the URL of the website is an official Roblox domain: roblox.com. Any website with a strange URL is likely a scam.
Unsolicited Offers:

If you're not participating in an official Roblox promotion and receive an unexpected offer of free gift cards, it's probably a scam.
What to Do If You Encounter a Scam
Do Not Provide Any Information:

Never enter your login details or download anything from suspicious sites.
Report the Scam:

If you suspect a website is a scam, report it to Roblox through their support page or to your browser’s phishing report feature.
Change Your Password:

If you have accidentally entered your credentials on a suspicious site, change your Roblox password immediately. Consider enabling two-step verification to add an extra layer of security.
Run a Malware Scan:

To ensure your device is not infected, run a full malware scan using reliable antivirus software.
How to Obtain Roblox Gift Cards Safely
Official Retailers:

Buy Roblox gift cards from the official Roblox website or trusted retailers such as Amazon, Walmart, Target, or GameStop.
Roblox Promotions:

Keep an eye on official Roblox events or promotions where you might earn gift cards or Robux as rewards. These are always announced through official Roblox channels.
Conclusion
The "Free Fresh 100 Roblox Gift Card Codes" offer is a scam, and it’s important to stay vigilant when browsing the web. Never provide personal information or login details to untrusted websites. Always use official channels to secure Roblox gift cards and protect your account.
